I welcome all you **self-driven learners** to my open learning initiative as we embark on a roller coaster ride towards upskilling ourselves

To start with, let's go through the below steps to get you onboarded :

### Step 1 : Vision of Mentorskool
--------------------------
* At Mentorskool, we are passionate about nurturing wholesome problem solvers driven by data. It takes more than a **Machine Learning** or **Deep Learning** to build problem solvers of tomorrow. Have a look at the video below to embrace our Vision. <br>

### Step 2 : Sneak peek into our projects
-------------------------------
* At Mentorskool, we believe that humans are innately creative and the best learning is achieved by testing real waters. So without wasting time, we present you a quick look at the projects we are currently working on.(Check <a href="https://github.com/mentorskool/Welcome/blob/master/docs/Projects-Repo.pdf" target="_blank">**here**</a>) <br><br>


### Step 3 : Understanding your better!
-------------------------------
* Convinced with what we are doing? If this excites you go ahead and let us know a bit about yourself! <br>

### Step 4 : One-on-One Connect
-------------------------------
* Congrats! You are just a step away from starting your project. At Mentorskool, we believe nothing beats the value of a face-to-face connect. We conduct quick 15 min sessions with all the new joinees on Sundays. Hold on till someone reaches out to you on slack. <br>
**Don't Worry!** We value your time! <br><br>
